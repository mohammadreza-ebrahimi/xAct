## [xAct](http://www.xact.es/). ***Efficient tensor computer algebra for the Wolfram Language***
This repository build for training one of the most important GR package in Wolfram Mathematica, ***xAct***.

> xAct is a suite of free packages for tensor computer algebra in the Wolfram Language. xAct implements state-of-the-art algorithms for fast manipulations of indices and has been modelled on the current geometric approach to General Relativity. It is highly programmable and configurable. Since its first public release in March 2004, xAct has been intensively tested and has solved a number of hard problems in GR.

xAct contains lots of concepts. I would briefly explain about what xAct actually is, how can you install it on your own PC, what are the most important packages in xAct and ... 

## Installation  
- **Windows**  
1. Copy the folder **xAct** which I uploaded  
2. In your user directory, `C:\Users\"YourUserName"\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications` paste the folder.
3. Open a mathematica notbook and run the command `<<xAct` with your appropriate package between two (`). 

- **Linux**  
1. Copy the folder **xAct** which I uploaded  
2. Active your root access
3. In your user directory, `root/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/"yourVersion"/addOnes/Applications` paste the folder.
4. Open a mathematica notbook and run the command `<<xAct` with your appropriate package between two (`).
