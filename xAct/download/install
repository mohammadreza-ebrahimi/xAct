****************************************
INSTALLATION NOTES FOR THE xAct PACKAGES
****************************************

The xAct packages are currently:

   Main: xCore, xPerm, xTensor and xCoba

   Applications: xPert, Harmonics, Invar and Spinors

   Contributed: xPrint, SymManipulator, AVF, xTras, TexAct, xPand,
      xTerior and SpinFrames

All packages can be downloaded as a single archive xAct_V.tgz
(linux or mac) or xAct_V.zip (windows) from the webpage

   http://www.xact.es/

The V in xAct_V represents the current version number of xTensor,
the leading package of the system. Note that the database of Riemann
relations in Invar must be downloaded separately!

When uncompressed, the archive files give a number of files hanging
from a directory called xAct/. This directory must be placed at
(or linked from) one of the places Mathematica prepares for external
applications. You can find the actual paths in your Mathematica
installation in the variables $BaseDirectory and $UserBaseDirectory.
You need the Applications/ subdirectory (or subfolder) of those
returned by those variables.

Linux:

   - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):

        /usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/

   - single-user installation:

        $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications/

Mac OS:

   - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):

        /Library/Mathematica/Applications/

   - single-user installation:

        /Users/<user>/Library/Mathematica/Applications/

MSWindows:

   - system-wide installation:

        C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application data\Mathematica\Applications\

   - single-user installation:

        C:\Documents and settings\<user>\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\

   Beware that in Windows these directories might be hidden!

To install xAct on a Raspberry Pi, do the following:

   Place the xAct tree in
      ~/.WolframEngine/Applications

   Run the following commands:

      cd ~/.WolframEngine/Applications/xAct/xPerm/mathlink/

      sudo apt-get install uuid-dev

      mcc xperm.tm -luuid -O3 -o xperm.linux.32-bit

Documentation files (like xTensorDoc.nb, etc) are placed in the xAct/Documentation/English directory.

Then the packages can be loaded using unix style

        <<xAct/xTensor.m

or Mathematica style

        <<xAct`xTensor`
