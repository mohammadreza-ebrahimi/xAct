	- Fixed problem with formatting of basis-indices in Prefix
	  notation for derivatives.
	- Changed "slave" by "servant".

=== 2005 =====================================

0.7.6:
	- Function SymmetrySlotsOfTensor made private. It is only used
	  by SymmetryEquivalentsOfTensor, which is already private.
	- Function SortDependencies made private.
	- Organized treatmente of PrintAs using the function SetPrintAs.
	- Introduced global variable $WarningFrom to get an idea of
	  where the warning-messages are coming from.
	- Functions up, IndexName moved in ScreenDollarIndices to get
	  less warning messages.
	- ReplaceOneIndex recoded on patterns. Now it only gives a
	  warning message if the pattern is actually replaced, and not
	  if a list of rules is attempted on the pattern.
	- Several sections reordered.
	- Introduced commands BeginExamples[] and EndExamples[] to
	  separate the Private and the Global contexts. Introduced
	  abbreviation xATP for xAct`xTensor`Private.
	*** Version 1.25 of CVS *** 4 March 2005 ***
	- Recoding of the canonicalization of monomials containing
	  a metric and derivatives which are not the corresponding
	  Levi-Civita derivative. This is done through extensive use
	  of ContractMetricOverDerivatives.
	- Full recoding of the ContractMetric section. Essentially the
	  number of definitions has doubled to ensure that the second
	  index of the metric factors is always contracted before the
	  first index.
	*** Version 1.26 of CVS *** 6 March 2005 ***
	- Corrected function careQ, which decides the canonicalization
	  algorithm to be used.
	*** Version 1.27 of CVS *** 7 March 2005 ***
	* Released 7 March 2005.

0.7.7:
	*** Version 1.28 of CVS *** 13 April 2005 ***
	- Recoded all defcovd functions in just one defcovd function.
	  This saves more than 200 lines of code in xTensor.m and is
	  easier to read.
        - Introduced functions SupermanifoldQ and DisjointManifolds,
	  replacing the uggly connectedmanifolds.
	- Corrected brackets of DerQ in DependenciesOf.
	- Corrected function ManifoldsOfTensor, introducing a Flatten
	  head.
	- Introduced option OrthogonalTo for DefTensor and DefCovD.
	- Introduced private function MakeOrthogonalDerivative.
	- Eliminated function SymmetrySlotsOfTensor. It was only being
	  used in SymmetryEquivalentsOfTensor, and was not really
	  needed.
	- Introduced option ProjectedWith for DefTensor and DefCovD.
	- Introduced option Vanishing for DefTensor.
	- Eliminated HoldIndices and $HoldIndices.
	- Added definition for ToCanonical on inert-head expressions.
	- Added option Linear for DefInertHead.
	- Started section of xTensorDoc on induced metrics.
	*** Version 1.29 of CVS *** 30 June 2005 ***
	* Released 30 June 2005.

0.7.8:
	- Added function JustOne.
	- Added head IndexList, which replaces a List of indices,
	  internally. Many functions are modified to work with
	  IndexList rather than List.
	- Added ValidateGIndex and ValidateIndexList.
	- DisjointManifoldsQ deprecated. Introduced function
	  ZeroDerivativeQ.
	- Added function DisorderedPairQ, to replace Not@IndexOrderedQ.
	- Changed = by := in ProductMetricRules.
	*** Version 1.30 of CVS *** 18 July 2005 ***
	- Added ZeroDerivativeQ[_,Basis]:=0 to avoid computing
	  DependenciesOfTensor[Basis].
	- Recoded function ExpandInBasis.
	- DerQ now only recognizes parametric derivatives with respect
	  to a single parameter. This is because DerQ is mostly used to
	  implement the Leibniz rule, which is only valid for single
	  derivatives.
	- Eliminated functions TorsionOfCovD and CurvatureOfCovD.
	- Modified IsIndexOf to admit {a,DefaultChart} when looking for
	  {a} and viceversa.
	- Added ManifoldOfBasis[DefaultChart]^=AllManifolds.
	- Added automatic contraction of Basis elements belonging to the
	  same basis.
	- All derivatives of admetric are now automatically expanded
	  into derivatives of the metric.
	- Added an important missing case in the function AD.
	- Added ContractBasisOverDerivatives and
	  ChangeBasisOverDerivatives.
	- Added RicciRotation coefficients. Ongoing work. Functions:
	  PDOfBasis, ChristoffelOf, StructureOfRicciRotation,
	  RicciRotationToChristoffel, ChristoffelToRicciRotation,
	  RicciRotationQ, UseRicciRotation.
	- Added signs RiemannSign and RicciSign.
	- Solved wrong index positioning in the Christoffels for the
	  function CovDToChristoffel.
	- Code for ChangeCovD is now legacy code.
	*** Version 1.31 of CVS *** 31 July 2005 ***
	- ManifoldsOf* changed again: now they do not return the
	  sub/supermanifolds of the actual manifolds. That was a source
	  of confusion and errors in ZeroDerivativeQ.
	- Added new definition for AD: now two (non-torsional)
	  derivatives of a scalar do generate a symmetric component
	  in SymmetryOf.
	- Add head LI (from Label Index) to include a fifth type of
	  g-index. It is very similar to Dir, but without any added
	  meaning. There is the head Labels, which is defined as the
	  manifold of all LI indices (dirty trick).
	- All patterns _?xTensorQ and co. converted into
	  x_Symbol?xTensorQ and co.
	- A message Validate::invalid from UltraindexOf is now not
	  thrown because it was halting the ouput from Information
	  concerning definitions associated to derivatives.
	- Added definitions for Trace*Dummy on lists. It was working
	  improperly because lists were treated as a single object.
	- Added function STFPart to compute the symmetric-tracefree
	  part of any tensor in any dimension. There are terribly many
	  symmetrizations to do, so that ToCanonical has been removed
	  from Symmetrize to speed up the computation.
	- Added function SetComponents to compute all components of
	  a tensor in a given basis (perhaps different for different
	  indices) from an arbitrary expression.
	- ZeroDerivativeQ now remembers its results on tensors to avoid
	  repeating the computation many times.
	- Added function makepattern to eliminate spurious messages from
	  the formatting of the Info information.
	- The ExtrinsicK tensor is removed when the induced metric is
	  removed.
	- Removed function ReorderDummies. It was only used as a last
	  step in ToCanonical and was giving problems when used with
	  several manifolds. Now its role is played by SameDummies,
	  which is much safer.
	- SymmetryOfTensor changed to SymmetryGroupOfTensor. This is
	  to avoid confusion between the (very different) outputs of
	  functions like SymmetryOf and the old SymmetryOfTensor.
	- Changed output symbol of slot from # to a dotted-square to
	  avoid confusion with the output of Slot.
	- Function displace changed to DisplaceSlots.
	- Functions SymmetryOf / SymmetryOfObject / symmetryof
	  rewritten into SymmetryOf / CovDSymmetryOf, which is simpler
	  to understand because it separates the difficult issues
	  concerning derivatives from SymmetryOf.
	- TermTimes changed to SortedTermTimes and MonomialTimes changed
	  to SortedMonomialTimes. Removed some unnecessary definitions
	  concerning canonicalization.
	*** Version 1.32 of CVS *** 7 October 2005 ***
	- BIndexQ checks that the basis integer is actually a
	  coordinate-number.
	- Treatment of Scalar expressions completely changed. Now it is
	  done as part of the normal process of canonicalization and
	  not independently by SimplificationScalar. The definition of
	  Simplification is now simply Simplify@ToCanonical.
	- Function GroupScalars has been rewritten and it is now called
	  PutScalar. Functions BreakScalars and NoScalar simplified.
	- BreakScalars is not now a part of Simplification.
	- Introduced EmptySymmetry.
	- Eliminated xsort. Definitions assigned to xSort directly.
	*** Version 1.33 of CVS *** 13 October 2005 ***
        - Eliminated "third element" of basis indices.
        - Temporary recoding of ContractBasis/ChangeBasis. The
          True/False switch has been moved to the head of the C*Basis1
          functions.
        - Section on bases and charts moved to a the new package
          xCoba.nb.
        - Added automatic rules for the multiplication of two epsilon
          tensors.
        - Added EpsilonSign.
        - Added rules etaUpToepsilon, etaDownToepsilon, epsilonToetaUp
          and epsilonToetaDown. They requiere one argument: a metric.
        - Added possibility of defining a manifold with a
          constant-symbol as dimension.
	- Recoded function AD. Not it is simpler to understand and more
	  general.
	- Added one more definition for SortedTermTimes, concerning its
	  product with a numeric quantity.
	- Recoded generic case of the functions M`Q. The previous coding
	  was too slow when the list of computer-generated indices was
	  too long. Now it is much faster, but there are remembered
	  upvalues for M`Q for all dollar-indices. Thanks to Alfonso
	  Garcia-Parrado for pointing out this problem.

	*** Version 1.34 of CVS *** 4 January 2006 ***
	*** Version 1.35 of CVS *** 9 January 2006 ***
	- Added function IndexSame to detect that {A,DefaultChart} and
	  {A} are actually the same index. Currently only used in the
	  function pairsin.
	- Replaced Expand[...] by FixedPoint[Expand, ...] (twice) in
	  the canonicalization routines, to avoid generating new
	  sums by automatic expansion of products, like in a*b*c
	  becoming a*(d+e) by expansion of b*c.
	- Added Factorial as a scalar-function by default.
	* Not released.

0.8.0:
	- The function MonomialsOfTerm now checks that the
	  scalar-functions actually contain indexed objects before
	  converting them into separate monomials.
	- The built-in Information is modified to avoid the context
	  xAct`xTensor`Private` crop in its output.
	- The expected version of xPerm is now a minimum version and
	  not the only possible version. We simply compare dates.
	- Introduced new section on Mathematical Input, dealing with
	  the mathematical expressions themselve, at a low level
	  (terms, factors, expansions and so on).
	- Any basis-index {i, DefaultChart} is automatically converted
	  into {i}.
	- PatternQ changed to PIndexQ which is much more careful with
	  the types of pattern that xTensor accepts.
	- Simplified programming of FindIndices.
	- The pair IndexPair/UpIndexPair replaces the function
	  horizontal avoiding duplication of messages from up.
	- Simplified Hold structure of ScreenDollarIndices.
	- Function defdeltaeta broken in two parts: defdelta and defeta.
	  The former is still associated to a manifold. The latter is
	  now associated to a manifold and a chart.
	- Added functions xTensorFormStart and xTensorFormStop which
	  can start and stop object formatting.
	- Many Evaluate heads have been eliminated by wrapping modules
	  with With.
	- Modified MakeRule to work with component indices. Simply added
          IndexName at definition of the lists of indices using the
	  fact that the replacement functions work on abstract indices.
	- GiveName replaced by GiveSymbol and GiveOutputName replaced by
	  GiveOutputString.
	- Reorganized the check for zero derivatives due to action on
	  a different manifold. It was automatic. Now it can be
	  automatic or user-driven. New functions CheckZeroDerivative
	  and similar.
	- Removed special version of ValidateCovD for directional
	  derivatives. The generic definition was also valid there.
	- Simplified formatting of derivatives. There was a third
	  redundant case.
	- Rewritten whole treatment of Christoffel tensors.
	- Added function BracketToCovD.
	- Solved small problem in the ordering of component indices.
	  Index -2 was being sorted before index -1.
	- Inert-heads can now have many arguments, but only the first
	  one must be tensorial. The tensorial properties of the whole
	  expression are those of the first argument.
	- Now UndefMetric removes the symbol, without need of
	  UndefTensor.
	- Added function FindRepeatedIndices. Modified ToCanonicalOne
	  to handle repeated indices (only in the xPerm code; not in
	  xperm.c). Uses the head RepeatedSet imitating DummySet.
 3 June	- Fully recoded xSort. Now it uses a parser (Identify and
	  MarkBlocked). ObjectSort is now much simpler and clear.
	  Changed ToCanonical accordingly. SymmetryOf not changed.
	- Added switch $CommuteFreeIndices.
15 June	- IndexList, FindIndices, FindFreeIndices, FindDummyIndices
	  made public.
16 June	- Automatic conversion of the delta of a product manifold into
	  the delta of one of its manifolds or zero.
17 June	- Added function SeparateDir.
	- ReplaceOneIndex now replaces blocked indices, and basis
	  indices as a whole.
18 June	- Added ChangeFreeIndices and EqualExpressionsQ to compare
	  two expressions with different free indices.
24 June - Fully updated xTensorDoc.nb.
25 June - Reintroduced BreakInMonomials and Monomial.
26 June - Further development of frozen metrics.
27 June - Solved problems in ToCanonicalDers. Now it directly uses
	  ChangeCovD. Needs generalization for non-CovD derivatives.
	- Added function LinearInertHeadQ. Now deltas can be contracted
	  through linear inert-heads.
 4 July - ToCanonical and ContractMetric threaded on equations (Equal).
	- For induced metrics we cannot use d(g^-1) = -(g^-2)dg
 6 July	*** Version 1.37 of CVS *** 6 July 2006 ***
	* Released 6 July 2006.

0.8.1 and 0.9.0:
23 July	- Added a definition on empty lists for ChangeFreeIndices to
	  avoid EqualExpressionsQ crashing when comparing scalars.
	- Added option Verbose to NewIndexIn.
30 July	- Symmetry checks in DefTensor are now more intelligent.
 1 Aug  - EqualExpressionsQ now accepts indices of several manifolds.
 3 Aug  - Removed association of coordinate-numbers to manifolds.
          Removed type CoordinateNumber: also removed CoordinateNumberQ
          and $CoordinateNumbers. Function ManifoldOfCoordinateNumber[i]
	  converted into private function ManifoldOfCIndex[i, basis]
	  only called by ManifoldOfIndex. 
 4 Aug  - Added global variable $CindexForm to print cnumbers using
	  the names of the coordinates instead.
	- Two manifolds cannot share a cnumber in their DefaultChart's.
 6 Aug	- Only left CNumbersOf[basis, manifold] or CNumbersOf[basis].
	  Now "cnumbers" are associated to bases. CIndexQ simplified.
	- Removed disjointmanifolds, redundant with DisjointManifoldsQ.
18 Aug	- Changed meaning of the DefaultChart. Now it represents a
	  particular chart which has been already defined, and not an
	  abstract chart always present. This requires the corresponding
	  change in xCoba.
	- Added type VectorBundle and associated objects. In progress.
 3 Sep	- Eliminated TypeOf, NonIndexedQ, NonIndexed, Mixed, only used
	  by the old canonicalizer.
 7 Sep	- Dropped definition of upIndex on and integers, because it is
	  a particular case of the general definition.
	- Removed DefaultChart. I tried to avoid it, but it was always
	  a headache.
	- Created a single delta tensor, instead of different delta
	  tensors for different vector bundles. Big change!
	- Introduced the Lovelock generalized delta tensor Gdelta.
	- The objects etaUp, etaDown now only depend on a basis. They
	  must be defined when defining a basis, and not with the
	  manifold or the vector bundle.
14 Sep	- Completed function DependenciesOf. Now the result is not
	  sorted according to SortDependencies.
 4 Oct  - Added DependenciesOf[parameter]={parameter}.
 6 Oct  - Removed SupermanifoldQ. Redundant with SubmanifoldQ.
19 Oct  - Changed definition sortder[ParamD[_]] to sortder[ParamD[__]]
	  to consider multiple derivatives. (Thanks to Guillaume Faye
	  for pointing out this problem.)
 1 Nov  - Added driver ContractMetric for CurvatureRelations.
	- Added MetricOfCovD[PD] ^= Null.
	- Corrected Lie derivatives on metric and epsilon tensors
	  (thanks to Alfonso Garcia-Parrado for pointing this out).
        - Corrected norm factors in InducedDecomposition
	  (thanks to Alfonso Garcia-Parrado for pointing this out).
 4 Nov	- Removed SupermanifoldsOfManifold. It is not used.
	- VectorBundle changed to VBundle and vb changed to vbundle.
	- Changed Module to With in some Module[{servants=...}, ...].
 5 Nov	- Changed priorities of IndexSort: free / lexicographic / up .
	- Rewritten IndexSort (which now uses Block instead of Module),
	  and IndexSortPriorities (which has been decomposed in several
	  pieces). Easier to understand and probably faster.
	- Added subsections "End of section" to have full control on the
	  created symbols.
	- $ComputeNewIndices and $FindIndicesAcceptedHeads made public.
	- Symbol Any changed to AnyIndices and made public because the
	  user could ask for FindIndices[0].
 6 Nov	- Private function setorthogonal converted into public function
	  SetOrthogonal.
	- eta tensors moved to xCoba because they always depend on a
	  basis choice.
 8 Nov	- Symbols delta, Gdelta, Basis, PD are now servants of symbol
	  Symbol, and hence cannot be undefined.
 22 Nov	*** Version 1.38 of CVS *** 22 Nov 2006 ***
	* Released 22 Nov 2006 with date 1 Nov 2006. Version 0.8.1.

 23 Nov *** Version 1.39 of CVS *** 23 Nov 2006 ***
 27 Nov - Fixes for several small bugs found by Alfonso.
 28 Nov - Fixed bug: there was a MetricOfCovD missing in
          makeChangeRicciRules. Thanks to Gilles Exposito Farese for
	  spotting this.
	- STFPart now uses FindFreeIndices instead of FindIndices
	  because I think it is not possible to do it consistently on
	  dummies. It also accepts a third argument to specify the
	  indices to symmetrize.
	- Added missing usage messages for public functions.
 4 Dec  - Corrected LieD of projected epsilon tensor. Thanks to Alfonso
	  for spotting this.
	* Released 4 Dec 2006. Version 0.9.0.

0.9.1:
 5 Dec  - Added SignatureOfMetric because it is needed when computing
	  the values of a normal or an orthonormal metric. We use the
	  slot of signet at definition time, but now with a list of
	  three elements (numbers of +1's, -1's and 0's).
	- Functions epsilonToeta* and viceversa moved to xCoba.
 8 Dec	- Added Hold during the construction of the rules in MakeRule.
28 Dec	- DaggerIndex on basis indices.

=== 2007 =====================================

 2 Jan	- MetricSign removed. Superceeded by SignatureOfMetric.
 2 Jan  - Code of IndexRuleDelayed and IndexSetDelayed rewritten in
	  order to handle automatically the problem of conflicting
	  dummies on the RHS.
 3 Jan	- Added option ExtendedFrom to DefCovD.
	- Added SymmetryOfMetric to handle antisymmetric metrics.
 4 Jan	- Added function TransposeDagger.
	- Added value Hermitian for option Dagger of DefTensor.
 9 Jan	- Rewritten part of the code of MakeRule to avoid unwanted
	  evaluations of the LHS and RHS of the rules. There are still
	  some checks where those expressions are evaluated.
	- Rewritten headers of the functions defcovd to transfer part
	  of the Module variables to With constructs. In particular this
	  improves the handling of the indices i1, i2, ...
10 Jan	- Solved a problem in Identify, related to recursive
	  identification of Plus expression within TensorTimes.
11 Jan	- Improved DependenciesOfIndex. Added AnyDependencies to avoid
	  having the default for DependenciesOf as {}, which was
	  making certain things to be automatically killed by ders.
	- Added possibility for bases to depend on both manifolds and
	  parameters. See DependenciesOfBasis in xCoba.
	- Recoded treatment of Dagger. Eliminated the ugly case
	  Dagger->Null.
15 Jan	- Removed optional argument "message" from ValidateDir.
	- Modified manipulation of LHS minus signs in MakeRule.
	*** Version 1.40 of CVS *** 15 Jan 2007 ***
	* Released 15 Jan 2007. Version 0.9.1.
16 Jan	- Corrected CheckRepeated on AnyIndices cases.
	- Corrected expandGdelta.
	- Changed sign of formula for LieD on epsilon tensors.
	- Changed DaggerIndex on basis indices. Now we use a function
	  in xCoba called DaggerCNumber.
17 Jan	- Added some Scalar1->Times rules in ToCanonical to remove some
	  Scalar1 heads left.
	* Second release 17 Jan 2007. Version 0.9.1.
18 Jan	- Changed function DaggerCNumber by DaggerBCIndex, more general.
29 Jan	- NonIndexedScalarQ now detects sums of nonindexed objects.
	- SymmetryOf now tries to remove nonindexed objects before
	  going into its generic definition.
	* Third release 29 Jan 2007. Version 0.9.1.

0.9.2:
	- Added function IndicesOf, the new user driver for index
	  selections.
21 Feb	- Changed Sort[...] by Union[upIndex/@...] in the computation of
	  LexicSorted in IndexSort. Now the c-indices are sorted
	  according to their absolute value in "lexicographic" priority.
	- FindIndices on a List is computed as FindIndices on Plus.
26 Feb	- Added WeightOfTensor[tensor_?xTensorQ]:=0 definition.
1 Mar	- Now Slot and SlotSequence indices are allowed, because they
	  are used by Coba in xCoba. Modified UpIndexQ and IndexForm
	  accordingly.
4 Mar	- Changed output of covd-dependent objects, like Christoffel,
	  Riemann, etc.
5 Mar	- ToCanonical generalized to admit not only a-index dummies,
	  but also b-index dummies.
	- Added missing definition for SymmetryOf on Bracket objects.
	- Added another definition for EmptySymmetry, with 2 arguments.
6 Mar	- Functions addhead need evaluation of their arguments to
	  canonicalize scalars through ToCanonicalScalar. First
	  argument (with HoldFirst) cannot be used, so it is now
	  redundant.
7 Mar	- Added check of general Bianchi identities (with torsion) to
	  xTensorDoc.nb.
20 Apr	- Added function SeparateMetric, inverse to ContractMetric.
	- Moved special basis AIndex from xCoba to xTensor, because it
	  is used by SeparateMetric.
22 Apr	- Moved SetNumberOfArguments, ToSymbol, Tilde, Underline,
	  ColorString to xCore. Moved also the issue of warnings and
	  messages.
2 May	- Added option Info to control all output info messages at
	  definition time.
8 May	- Rereading of xTensor.nb. Rerun all examples.
9 May   - Changed notation of bc-indices: {a, basis} and {-a,-basis}
          for b-indices and {1, basis} and {1, -basis} for c-indices.
11 May  - Added function xCollect. Not finished.
15 May  - Reorganized welcome messages in all of xAct.
	- Added value False for option Info.
20 May  - Reorganized section on induced derivatives.
21 May	- Added option FrobeniusQ for DefTensor. Still not in use by
          the induced metric stuff.
	- Commented out definition of covd on Scalar objects because
          it leads to infinite recursion after using
          InducedDecomposition.
22 May  - Lots of changes concerning induced metrics. Essentially the
          system is now far more intelligent, though slower. In
          particular ToCanonical and ContractMetric are now fully
          aware of induced metrics.
23 May  - Reviewed xTensorDoc.nb. It has 1000 cells now!
        - Rewritten part of the function ReplaceDummies.
        - $ComputeNewIndices changed to $ComputeNewDummies.
4 Jun	- Added private function RemoveDollarIndices.

	- Some functions of section 1 of xTensor moved to xCore.
	- Reviewed sections 1-5 of xTensor.
30 Jun	- Added a first version of SplitIndex.
1 Jul	- Improved treatment of contexts of capitals C,D,K,N,O.
	- Started function Tex, based on strings.
	- Reviewed sections 6-9 of xTensor.
2 Jul   - Started review of Symmetry section. ToCanonical reorganized.
5 Jul	- Solved problem with CommutingObjects and metrics blocked by
          non-compatible derivatives.

	  CanonicalPerm to change xPerm to Renato's notation.
	- Further reorganization of the properties of inert heads.
	- Another revision of xTensorDoc.nb.
11 Jul	- Finished work on inert heads. It is clear that it can be done
	  better.
	- Reorganized special canonicalization algorithm for
	  non-compatible derivatives. Now the process is clearer.
	  Removed AlreadyCanonicalized.
29 Jul	- Added $SymmetryCommuteCovDsOnScalars to stop commutation of
	  covds on scalars in DInvar.
	- Added IndexRange to avoid typing lots of indices at
	  definition time.
7 Aug	- Removed every mention of spinors in xTensor.
10 Aug	- The Ashtekar notation for densities is now an option, and
	  not compulsory, to simplify tensor formatting, and to allow
	  greater flexibility.
	- Option Weight renamed WeightOfTensor. Weight removed.
	  Weights are now linear combinations of bases.
13 Aug	- Pattern _Symbol?ScalarFunctionQ changed to _?ScalarFunctionQ
	  to allow the InChart[__][__] functions of xCoba.
	- Created SequenceBox to format sequence of arguments.
14 Aug	- ChangeCovD does not see basis-indices anymore.
	- Introduced public function SetCharacters.
	* Released 15 August 2007. Version 0.9.2.

	- Added special PD-PD definition in changeCovD.
17 Aug	- All derivatives are now mapped over lists.

20 Sep  - Fixed parenthesization of ToCanonicalObject on Scalar1.
        - Added DaggerIndex in the action of Dagger on covds.
        - Definitions for Dagger on Power.
22 Sep	- Updated help files for the *Manifold* commands.
23 Sep	- Tangent bundles are servants of their base manifolds.
	- Updated help files for the *VBundle* commands, and others up
          to a total of 100 files.
24 Sep  - Updated 44 more help files related to indices.
25 Sep  - Updated 14 more help files related to tensors.
15 Oct  - Continue working on the documentation. 203 updated files so
	  far.

22 Oct  - Function addOther added in CommuteCovDs to handle non-abstract
          indices and upper characters.

26 Oct  - Function UncatchedValidate made private.
27 Oct  - Directory xTensor added to the CVS repository.
	- Removed everything related to Form type. It should be DForm,
	  in case this is reintroduced.
28 Oct	- Function xCollect renamed as IndexCollect.
	- Finished documenting the 330 public symbols of xTensor.
	- Removed test ?vbpmq from the a_ pattern in
	  CD[a_][metric[_,_]] := 0 for a metric and its Levi-Civita CD.
 1 Nov	- Introduced notation for definition of a variable rank tensor:
	  DefTensor[T[a, AnyIndices[vb]], M]. ValidateTensor is
	  deactivated on such tensors.
 2 Nov	- Introduced function TraceDummy and its related variable
	  $TraceDummyVerbose.
 4 Nov	- SubmanifoldQ and SubvbundleQ now work through upvalues in
	  their first argument.
	- 0-dim and 1-dim manifolds are now possible.
	- 1-dim vbundles are possible. Tensors with indices on a 1-dim
	  vbundle are symmetric on those indices having the same
	  character.
	* Released 6 November 2007. Version 0.9.3.

0.9.4:
12 Nov  - New function SubdummiesIn.
        - New code for TraceProductDummy in terms of TraceDummy and
          SubdummiesIn. Much simpler.
17 Nov	- Fixed a bug in ContractMetric. There was xTensorQ where there
          must be CovDQ in the function PRJ. This affected only induced
	  covds. Thanks to Cyril Pitrou for spotting this.
        - covdchecks changed to DefCovDCheck and metricchecks changed to
          DefMetricCheck.
	- Rewritten function addOther to handle induced derivatives.

	  tensors in InChart expressions.
24 Dec	- Changed convention of epsilonSign: now +1 with covariant
	  indices.

=== 2008 =====================================

 3 Jan  - DefMetric only accepts metrics fields with indices on tangent
          bundles. Otherwise DefCovD in DefMetric complains.
20 Jan	- DaggerSymbolQ changed to HasDaggerCharacterQ to avoid
	  confusion with DaggerQ.
	- Removed Linear. Now both option and function are called
	  LinearQ.
26 Jan	- upIndex, downIndex, change renamed as UpIndex, DownIndex,
	  ChangeIndex.
	- Several functions upQ/downQ restricted to UpIndexQ/DownIndexQ.
	- Removed (obsolete) deltaperm code.
27 Jan	- Dropped nopatterns. It wasn't being used.
	- Improved function symperms, now accepting repeated indices.
	- Added a careQ warning in MakeRule.
	- Updated section on Index Notations to allow the new notations
	  Polar[a] and -Polar[2]. Also pure integers.
	- Renamed several functions in the Indices section.
	- Introduced function FindBlockedIndices.
30 Jan	- Replaced fast patterns in DefMetric by UpIndexQ, EIndexQ, etc.
 2 Feb  - Completed handling of the double notations BASIS1 and BASIS2
          for bc-indices.
        - Most of the Cases constructs in SelectIndices have been
          replaced by simpler (but slower) Select constructs to avoid
          the explicit use of patterns.
        - Simplified code for metric contractions through inert-heads.
 5 Feb	- Functions GradMetricToChristoffel y ChristoffelToGradMetric
	  generalized to work with any type of indices.
	- Directional arguments of (first-)metrics are automatically
	  converted into normal expressions.

17 Feb	- Changed $MathLink to $xpermQ, following the change in xPerm.
23 Feb	- TraceDummy threads over lists.
26 Feb  - Added private global variable $RepeatedSingletonsQ to control
          canonicalization of repeated indices.
 2 Mar  - Changed ToCanonicalOne because now the D group is handled
          using indices instead of slots in xPerm.
 4 Mar	- Removed option MathLink, which has been transferred to xPerm.
          In particular MathLink->True is now an option of
          CanonicalPerm, and not of ToCanonical.
	*** Version 1.42 of CVS *** 5 Mar 2008 ***
	* Released 5 March 2008. Version 0.9.4.

0.9.5:
13 Mar  - Function putmetric in MakeRule modified to work with spinor
          metrics.
14 Mar  - OrthogonalToVector now knows that the Lie derivative of a
          spatial tensor along the orthogonal vector is also spatial.
          Thanks to Alfonso for pointing this out.
21 Mar	- FindIndices on inert-heads generalized to find the indices
	  on additional index-arguments.
	- Name analysis and other stuff in section 1 transferred to
	  xCore. Only left the usage messages and the "begin package".
	- Functions UnknownSymbols and related removed.
	- Generalized sections 1-7 (mainly FindIndices, IsIndexOf and
	  ReplaceIndices) to have several indices in the CovD and
	  Bracket index-arguments. Only DerQ has not been generalized.
	- DerQ renamed as FirstDerQ for clarity.
	- Further generalization of additional index-arguments of
	  inert-heads. Now they don't need to have a subset of the
	  indices of the expr. The indices of the whole expression
	  are taken to be the (unsorted) union of the indices of the
	  expr and the additional indices.
22 Mar	- Generalized IndexForm to format lists of indices.
	- Generalized AddIndex to work with multiple-indices
	  derivatives.
	- Private function setprojected converted into an extended
	  public function SetProjected, which imitates SetOrthogonal.
	- Private function OrthogonalToVector renamed as
	  OrthogonalToVectorQ because it is Boolean.
	- DefTensor reorganized, separating a function performing
	  general checks, and another one performing symmetry checks.
	- Introduced function SymmetryTableauxOfTensor for future needs.
	- Private function PermuteObject generalized and converted into
	  the public function PermuteIndices.
23 Mar	- Introduced value Antihermitian for option Dagger of DefTensor.
	- Improved treatment of Dagger option in DefTensor.
	- A bit of cleaning in DefProductMetric.
	- All of xTensor.nb reexecuted after a long time.
 6 Apr	- Daggered objects (constant-symbols, vbundles and tensors)
	  are now servants of their non-daggered paired. This simplifies
	  definition / undefinition. Indices treated as usual.
20 Apr	- Sign variables now have a $ in front.
	- Started encoding of riggings.
22 Apr	- Fixed problem in DummyAs affecting SeparateMetric. Thanks to
	  Juan Jose Lopez-Villarejo for spotting this.
	- Reversed arguments basis, metric to metric, basis in
	  SeparateMetric, which seems more reasonable to me.
	- CheckRemoveSymbol now does not complain if the symbol has
	  servants. This was stupid.
	- An inner vbundle is an object of its base manifold. (Recall
	  that a tangent bundle is a servant of its base manifold.)
 1 May	- AIndex is a basis (gives True under BasisQ) colored in black.
	- Introduced new public option/function WeightedWithBasis for
	  covds.
	- Reintroduced weights in ChangeCovD, ExpandLieD and
	  ExpandProductMetric. In the first case the formula is general
          for all bases, but not in the other two cases.
 2 May	- MakeDefineInfo renamed as MakeDefInfo, and MakeUndefineInfo
	  rename as MakeUndefInfo.
	- nodollar capitalized to NoDollar, and dollarQ to DollarQ.
 3 May	- FindIndices now finds indices of tensor patterns like
	  tensor_?xTensorQ[a_,b_,c_] and patterns for covds.
	- Now metric connections can have torsion. I'm not sure which
	  formulas survive and which do not.
 4 May	- FrobeniusQ now has a default value False, and so it is only
	  given upvalues when having value True.
	- First code for variational derivatives.
 7 May	- Much improved code of IndexCoefficient. Now IndexCollect is
	  a recursive function based on IndexCoefficient. Thanks to
	  Juanjo Lopez-Villarejo for discussions on this pair of
	  functions.
10 May	- Function FrozenMetricQ is now computed on real time, instead
	  of having upvalues.
        - A more flexible version of MakeLinearDerivative.
12 May  - Ultraindices removed! Only UltraindexOf has been left. Now
          ToCanonicalDir replaces the ultraindex with the first
	  user-index.
        - A new full rewriting of IndexCoefficient.
        - New function SymmetryEquivalentsOf, generalizing the previous
          SymmetryEquivalentsOfTensor, which still exists. Both private.
13 May  - DefManifold and DefVBundle with ultraindex argument convert it
          into the last index and print a legacy message.
        - Updated xTensorDoc.nb. Some new examples on VarD and
          IndexCoefficient.
15 May	- Improved section on symbol relations. The old "objects" are
	  now called "visitors" to distinguish them from the Object
	  expressions of Identify. Visitors have "hosts" and now there
	  are functions VisitorsOf (the old ObjectsOf) and HostsOf.
	  The function MasterServant has been changed to 
	  SymbolRelations, which now also handles visitors and hosts.
	* Released 16 May 2008. Version 0.9.5.
29 May  - SeparateMetric now also separates the indices of a covariant
          derivative. Thanks to Juanjo for pointing this out.
	* Rereleased 29 May 2008. Version 0.9.5.

0.9.6:
31 May  - Eliminated dangerous upvalues of AIndex.
 4 Jun  - AbsDet moved back from xCoba to xTensor. Motivated by xPert.
10 Jun  - IsIndexOf[{},_,_]:= False, instead of the old (computed) True.
11 Jun  - Introduced pair Implode / Explode.
18 Jun  - Removed AbsDet and introduced Determinant, with same code,
          but not including the absolute value. Cleaner and simpler.
          AbsDet behaved incorrectly under complex changes of basis.
          Thanks to Alfonso for noticing this problem.
        - DefMetric now automatically defines the determinant in the
          basis AIndex, as used to do in the past.
19 Jun  - SetPrintAs broken into three parts: SetPrintAs, PrintAsString
          and AddDaggerCharacter, for clarity. Equivalent behaviour.
20 Jun  - Cleaning of ToCanonicalObject. Intermediate function tocanonical
          removed. Part of its role is now played by Reconstruct.
        - puthead now worries about GivePerm.
        - ToCanonicalOne now returns {0, indices} instead of 0, to
          have a homogeneous answer. Here indices are those at input.
        - Reorganization of removeTMPCovD: simpler recursion.
27 Jun  - Added Reverse in all Undef/@Reverse[servants] constructs.
          The servants must be undefined in reverse order because there
          could be mutual relations.
28 Jun  - Added tensor Tetra of a metric, motivated by Spinors`.
29 Jun  - Now tensors are also visitors of their slot vbundles.
        - Modified SymbolRelations to take into account masters of masters.
30 Jun  - All indices in directions and scalars are replaced in the rhs
          of IndexRule and similar, to avoid collisions with patterns on
          the lhs, as pointed out by Alfonso.
        - Adsded function ReplaceIsolated, to handle isolated indices on
          the RHS of rules.
        - Fixed TransposeDagger. It was wrong with c-indices.
	* Released 30 June 2008. Version 0.9.6.

0.9.7:
 2 Jul  - Patterns now don't send a message under ReplaceIndex.
 4 Jul  - Introduced concept of "isolated expressions" and code for it.
        - MakeRule now acts on isolated expressions via a call to itself.
 5 Jul  - Further extensions for multi-index derivatives.
        - Improved Implode/Explode on complex objects.
 6 Jul  - The All definition of IndexOnQ transferred to SubvbundleQ, to
          validate delta tensors.
        - Only delta[-a, b] is allowed now on vbundles without metric.
        - delta has now the symmetries of the (first-) metric of the
          vbundle of its indices. This is controlled through the new
          private function SymmetryOfIndex, a call to SymmetryOfMetric.
 2 Aug  - Introduced head Pair for dagger pairs.
        - Cleaned code of TransposeDagger.
 8 Aug  - Introduced function FormatTensor to format tensor components in
          an arbitrary way. This could be in xCoba, but it's nearly
          identical to xTensorForm for tensors (which is in xTensor).
 9 Aug  - Added error message for SignatureOfmetric.
        * Released 11 August 2008. Version 0.9.7.

0.9.8:
13 Aug  - Removed check of base manifolds on sum-vbundles: we do not
          need a product-manifold. All vbundles can have the same base.
 4 Sep  - Function Symmetry1D to simplify expressions with indices in
          1D vbundles.
 9 Sep  - Now symmetrization of 1D abstract indices is performed in
          real time in ToCanonical, and not at DefTensor. This is more
          general, in particular valid on tensor products.
15 Sep  - All curvature tensors vanish for a metric in a 1d vbundle.
 1 Oct  - Introduced function ToInducedDerivative, as suggested by Cyril.
        - Introduced function DirCovDToLieD, as suggested by Cyril.
        - Added Lie cases in GradNormalToExtrinsicK.
        - Implode conflicts with induced derivatives.
 2 Oct  - Fixed SeparateMetric. The see-saw convention was reversed.
          Thanks to Alfonso for pointing this out.
 5 Oct  - Fixed a number of problems with variational derivatives. Note
          that they do not obey the Leibnitz rule on products. Example:
          VariationalD[g[x]f'[x],f[x],x] = -g'[x] and not 0.
13 Oct  - Added ContractMetric in the OToVcheck. This solves a problem
          in Implode with induced derivatives.
14 Oct  - Fixed SetOrthogonal.
        - VarD now acts on powers.
16 Oct  - Added command GaussCodazzi.
20 Oct  - DaggerIndex and IndexForm now act on LI[___], not only LI[_].
22 Oct  - The $*Sign variables are now constant symbols. Their integer
          powers are converted into 1 or themselves.
 2 Nov  - Weyl also exists for metric connections with torsion, as
          pointed out by Alfonso.
 3 Nov  - Introduced command Cyclize.
        - Symmetrize and Antisymmetrize with one argument expr act on all
          free indices of expr.
13 Nov  - Added third argument {1} of Position, in IndexSort, to avoid
          confusion with indices in Dir.
        - Added Catch in all DefType and UndefType functions, following
          Guillaume's suggestion.
        - Implemented "hiding of attributes of Times", as suggested by
          Michael Trott, to avoid the combinatorial explosion in delta
          contraction.
        - Added context xAct`ExpressionManipulation` to ColorTerms.
        - Reexecuted xTensorDoc.nb.
20 Nov  - Introduced DaggerCovD, to deal with the "Hermitian" spincovds
          with two indices.
        - TransposeDagger now also acts on lists with head IndexList.
22 Nov  - Treatment of derivatives of metric determinants simplified.
        - Added a fourth argument in ImposeSymmetry and related functions.
23 Nov  - Added option Method in ToCanonical, to choose between the old
          ChangeCovD-based algorithm for canonicalization with
          non-compatible derivatives and the new Implode-based algorithm.
        - Symbols for covds are now an option SymbolOfCovD. Old syntax
          kept for backwards compatibility.
	* Released 23 November 2008. Version 0.9.8.

0.9.9:
 8 Dec  - Removed Simplify from ToCanonicalScalar. It was preventing the
          use of Expand on Scalar expressions.
        - Fixed variational derivatives on functions. The derivative of
          the function must go into the rest, and not just outside the
          derivative. Thanks to Cyril for pointing this out.
        - New code for NoScalar. Safer. Does not remove Scalar if it is
          essential. Thanks to Guillaume and Bala for pointing this out.

=== 2009 =====================================

 3 Jan  - Completed working version of TexPrint. Created TexBreak.
 9 Jan  - Added special definition for NonIndexedScalarQ expressions in
          ReplaceDummies.
        - Added missing definition TMPCovD[0,_]:=0.
13 Jan  - Added global variable $Info, to deactivate all info messages.
15 Jan  - Introduced option OtherDependencies for DefCovD and DefMetric.
          Now covds, metrics and all their associated objects can have
          additional dependencies.
        - Introduced DependenciesOfCovD, so that now covds add other
          dependencies. On PD it gives {}.
17 Jan  - Implode with PD now creates PDMtensor, where M is a manifold,
          in those cases in which the tensor has several manifold
          dependencies.
        - Fixed Cyclize (ReplaceList changed to ReplaceAll). Now we divide
          by the number of terms, consistently with ImposeSymmetry.
21 Jan  - Fixed ToCanonicalDir, which was changing the character of the
          vector or covector inside Dir.
        - Added ToCanonicalIndex inside the definition of ToCanonical on
          single tensors.
26 Jan  - Added definition for NoScalar on (first-order) derivatives.
14 Feb  - BIndexQ doesn't check now compabitility between the a-index i
          and the basis in {i, basis}. We just use AIndexQ and BasisQ.
        - VBundleOfIndex on b-indices uses the a-index. On c-indices it
          still uses the basis, via VBundleOfBasis.
10 Mar  - Introduced public function SplitManifold, which adds much
          flexibility in defining product manifolds, as suggested by
          Guillaume. Code simplified. In particular RegisterManifold
          has been removed.
        - Parallel change for vbundles, with a function SplitVBundle.
        - There are no checks now on dimensions at definition time.
          Any expression can be a dimension. The Split* functions check
          compatibility.
18 Mar  - Introduced function SetSplitTensors.
19 Mar  - Function SplitTensor.
15 Jun  - Added ChangeFreeIndices[0, _List] := 0 . Thanks to Alfonso for
          spotting this.
        - The STFPart::wrongsym message is now only sent, not thrown,
          following a related recommendation by Guillaume.
17 Jun  - Started implementing CovD derivatives, as suggested by Guillaume.
          It should be more general: Der[expr, ders__], where ders could
          be of any type.
 9 Jul  - Added code for LaTeX formatting of derivatives of scalar
          functions.
11 Jul  - All functions with attribute NumericFunction are now considered
          as scalar-functions by xTensor. Now we do not need to have a
          special initial list of scalar-functions.
        - Removed head NumberOfArguments for scalar functions, which was
          not being used.
18 Jul  - Added a check of ranks in IndexCoefficient3, to allow for
          variable-rank tensors.
25 Jul  - Scalar-functions can now be declared as Real, Imaginary or
          Complex. The NumericFunctions of Mathematica are all assumed
          to be real, in the sense of staying invariant under complex
          conjugation of their arguments.
        - checkChristoffelIndices is now less restrictive, allowing
          indices of subvbundles. Commented out old code for comparison.
 5 Aug  - Added Kretschmann scalar.
 6 Aug  - Added Leibnitz operator, following Jan's suggestion.
        - Added RiemannDown, and solved the inconsistencies with curvature
          tensors of frozen metrics, found when working with Estelita and
          Irene.
16 Aug  - I've run "Scan for possible issues" again on xTensor and I see
          that ParameterQ was a reserved word in Statistics`Common`. It
          has been now renamed DistributionParameterQ there. Harmless.
	* Released 9 September 2009. Version 0.9.9. "Chus version".
14 Sep  - SeparateDir with two arguments.
        - More powerful ContractDir, following ContractMetric. In
          particular, now it handles properly derivatives, and has an
          OverDerivatives option. Thanks to Thomas Backdahl for
          discussions on this command.
23 Sep  - (This is more a xAct comment than a xTensor comment): mixed
          xAct webpage and xAct development directory, to make simpler
          moving both things around...
18 Nov  - As pointed out by Alex, extended derivatives associated to a
          metric were not fully coded up. Added two definitions, as
          discussed in the group: Christoffel[CD,cd]=0, if CD is an
          extension of cd, and CD[-a][metric[_?AIndexQ,_?AIndexQ]]:=0
          if cd[-a][metric[-b,-c]]==0.
20 Nov  - Changed treatment of derivatives on Scalar expressions.
          Scalar is kept under parametric and Lie derivatives, but
          covariant derivatives and Lie derivatives convert Scalar
          into ReplaceDummies before acting on the expression. Scalar
          could be introduced with PutScalar, but that could be slow,
          as pointed out by Guillaume.
        * Rereleased 24 November 2009. Version 0.9.9.
11 Dec  - Fixed a missing comma in the new formatting of Scalar. Thanks
          to Leo Stein for pointing this out.
25 Dec  - NumberOfArguments removed from the documentation.
          Thanks to Sebastian Szybka for pointing this out.
        - As pointed out by Alessandro (magma), the $Info variable
          is not able to turn off Undef messages. Now $Info converted
          into two independent global variables $DefInfo and $UndefInfo.
          Info changed to DefInfo, because Info is too general. There is
          no UndefInfo option/function yet.
        - Also pointed out by Alessandro, chart undefinition was leaving
          Removed symbols in VisitorsOf[M]. Solved by appending hosts,
          instead of setting them (that assumes the setting is done only
          once, and that is not true with charts, which are also bases).
        - Reexecuted xTensor.nb. Fixed some examples with respect to the
          presence or not of a metric. Added a couple of trivial
          Module[{prot=...},...] constructions.
	*** Version 1.46 of CVS *** 31 December 2009 ***

=== 2010 =====================================

        * Rereleased 10 January 2010. Version 0.9.9.

1.0.0:
25 Jan  - Introduced head Sym, following suggestions by Thomas Bäckdahl,
          as discussed in the group.
26 Jan  - Added ReplaceDummies on the RHS of VarD acting on scalar functions
          because the initial ReplaceDummies does not act on the arguments
          of scalar functions. Thanks to Leo Stein for reporting in the xAct
          group the problem caused by that.
29 Jan  - Changed all (but one) patterns _Symbol?xTensorQ to _?xTensorQ to
          allow for more flexible tensor pattern heads. Introduced Tensor
          objects which contain their info as arguments, instead of going
          through DefTensor.   
        - Introduced a generalized form of delta, called Sdelta[sym][inds],
          the "superdelta", to help in the canonicalization of Sym objects.
 2 Feb  - ImplicitTensorDepQ made public because there are problems in which
          the user needs to set a nondefault upvalue for it, as in an example
          posted by Jörg in the xAct group.
 3 Feb  - Fixed handling of Sym canonicalization for spinor metrics. Problems
          found by Thomas.
 4 Feb  - Added CheckRepeated in ValidateTensor to check for repeated indices.
          Found while constructing xPrintValidQ for Alessandro.
12 Feb  - SymmetryOf has a NonIndexedScalarQ check on products which is very
          slow when there are many terms. Used technique of hiding attributes
          to make it faster.
18 Feb  - Accepted tensor weights in which the coefficient is a constant, and
          not necessarily a numeric quantity.
24 Feb  - Generalized GradMetricToChristoffel and ChristoffelToGradMetric to
          work with frozen metrics. Not yet for induced metrics.
          Also ChangeCurvature.
 4 Mar  - ReplaceDummies now calls ReplaceDummies2[expr,...] instead of the
          old ReplaceDummies2[MathInputExpand[expr],...]. This change could
          lead to results having a different, hopefully simpler, form.
        - Cleaning and small improvements in the section 5.7.5 on
          ReplaceDummies and SameDummies.
 5 Mar  - IndexList[___] now formats with blue ($IndexListColor) braces.
        - The message Validate::repeated from CheckRepeated is now only sent,
          not thrown. This is to proceed in the 1dim case with repeated
          indices.
 9 Apr  - Solved problem in SeparateMetric, which made the function not work
          on non-indexed scalars. Solved by changing Join@@somelist to
          Flatten[IndexList@@somelist], where somelist is a list of IndexList
          expressions. The problem was the special case somelist={}. Thanks
          to Torsten for reporting this problem in the group.
18 Apr  - Added ShowAutoStyles->False in interpretbox to avoid the blue
          coloring of indices in Mathematica 6+ after copy-pasting.
          Thanks to Alessandro for spotting this problem.
        - Added line ReplaceOneIndex[i:slot[_],rules_]:=Replace[i,rules];
          to allow slot-expressions to be replaced by normal indices.
          Suggested by Thomas.
25 Apr  - IndexLength computes lengths from PrintAs[index] and not from index,
          because what we actually show is the PrintAs form. Thanks to
          Guillaume for finding this.
        - NewIndexIn now creates indices in the same context of the LastIndex.
          Suggested by Guillaume.
        - SetPrintAs now uses StripContext to remove the context of a symbol
          in its PrintAs form. Suggested by Guillaume.
26 Apr  - Started implementation of projectors, following discussions with
          Guillaume. Projected and MakeProjectors. $ProjectedFormat.
28 Apr  - Motivated by the new formatting of projected indices, the functions
          constructing boxes for tensor formatting are modified. Now they are
          based on GridBox, instead of SubsuperscriptBox. Both codes are left,
          with the global variable $TensorBoxes to switch among them.
18 May  - Introduced Mapping & company, after discussions with Alfonso at AEI.
        - Extended syntax of DefManifold to define submanifolds.
13 Jun  - Added TensorD and TensorDerivative. It is faster than ChangeCovD and
          Implode, and seems simple to program.
14 Jun  - christoffelToGradMetric acting on metricovd = PD returns the expr.
          This is to avoid converting Christoffels into covariant derivatives
          of Cartesian metrics. Thanks to Istvan Racz for finding this problem.
        - ZeroDerivativeQ now performs pm`Q checks to avoid confusing manifolds
          when using PD. Thanks again to Istvan.
17 Jun  - Fixed problem in SortCovDsStart. Changed a RuleDelayed by SetDelayed.
          Thanks to Alessandro for reporting this problem. Slight rewriting of
          SortCovDsStart/Stop to avoid Evaluate.
 6 Aug  - Removed one of two ; at the end of TexCovDCombine, which was being
          interpreted as Span. Thanks to Barry for reporting this.
25 Aug  - Function DefSign, to define constant symbols representing signs.
23 Sep  - Now we admit frozen metrics with associated connection with torsion.
        - Encoded general contracted Bianchi identity, with torsion and for
          first and frozen metrics.
24 Sep  - Improved formatting and symmetries of TensorDerivative objects.
	* Released 30 September 2010. Version 1.0.0.

=== 2011 =====================================

1.0.1:
29 Jan  - As pointed out by Alessandro, IndexLength counts all characters of
          StyleBox[...] symbols, like colored commas. Returned to the previous
          convention of assigning length 1 to any comma-object.
        - Added missing comma in SetNumberOfArguments[Sym{1,3}].
	- Added missing definition of TensorDerivative on LI indices.
18 Feb	- Extended VarD to work on expressions with free indices, as requested
	  by several people in the group. Not tested at all. Does not work on
	  expressions with derivatives of the differentiation variables, as
	  pointed out by Leo, as xTensor cannot extract the test function then.
28 Feb	- Solved problem found by Cyril on the treatment of symmetries of
	  double derivatives of scalars, by describing group orders as a list
	  instead of a number inside Object.
 6 Mar	- Mathematica 8 dollar symbols produce a$101 and a$101$. This requires
	  a slight twist in RemoveDollarIndices.
10 Mar	- Fixed a typo in SignatureOfMetric, that was affecting MetricInBasis.
	  Detected by Alfonso.
11 Mar	- TexBreak improved using ideas and code by Barry Wardell.
	- Tex formatting of indices improved using ideas and code by Thomas
	  Backdahl.
15 Mar	- DefCovD[ cd[-a] ] now checks that a belongs to a tangent vbundle.
	- TorsionQ was not being inherited by extended derivatives, as
	  detected by Alfonso.
16 Mar	- Proper ordering of delta indices in VarD, as suggested by David
	  Brizuela.
18 Mar	- ToInducedDerivative generalized to work with Lie derivatives as
	  suggested by Cyril.
	- The weighted part of LieDToCovD is a divergence of the vector,
	  instead of a LieD of the metric along the vector, to avoid the use
	  of a metric. PD is now by default weighted in the basis AIndex.
	  Suggested by David.
	- Fixed a Not[A,B] in SymDers that should have been Not[A]&&Not[B].
	  Thanks to Cyril for finding and tracking this down.
10 Apr	- Added basic support for conformal transformations, after discussions
	  with Cyril Pitrou and Thomas Backdahl. A conformal transformation is
	  specified using the option ConformalTo->{metric,confactor} in
	  DefMetric. Information is stored in ConformalFactor and (general)
	  ConformalRules. Christoffel changes between connections is done with
	  ChristoffelToGradConformal. Indices CANNOT be moved with the
	  conformal metric; only with the first metric, as usual in xTensor.
12 Apr	- Added global variable $TexIndicesInitialBracesQ, suggested by Thomas.
	* Released 17 April 2011. Version 1.0.1.

20 Apr	- Fixed Christoffel relation for conformal transformations, as reported
	  by Cyril. Several small extensions suggested by him. Added function
	  SetConformalTo, which allows setting conformal relations of already
	  declared metrics.
23 Apr	- SortCovDsStart/Stop generalized to work with both up and down indices,
	  as SortCovDs does. Thanks to Cyril for finding and fixing this.
	* Rereleased 27 April 2011. Version 1.0.1.

15 May	- Improved Tex on products, sums and powers, after a bug found by Thomas
	  with the product of two sums.
	- As suggested by Leo, SetOrthogonal and SetProjected now accept input
	  SetOrthogonal[ T[AnyIndices[vb]], vector ]. OrthogonalToVectorQ still
	  refuses to call OToVcheck because it is not clear that orthogonality
	  for 13 indices means orthogonality for any number of indices.
	* Rereleased 15 May 2011. Version 1.0.1.

1.0.2:
20 May	- Fixed TexPrint with exponents. Added $VerboseParenthesationLevel, with
	  default False.
 9 Jul	- As suggested by Thomas, we now assume that the base of any SGS is formed
	  by the sorted list of moved points, for safe compatibility with the
	  option OrderedBase->True, which produces the nicest output. The function
	  SGSofsym has been modified to inforce that.
	- Code of SeparateMetric partially modified so that it first localize
	  the tensors to act on, and then computes the indices to separate. This
	  fixes the problem reported by Leo on May 2 in the xAct group.
	- Added formatting for ParamD. The global variable $ParamDFormat controls
	  this. Currently it takes values "Prefix", "SinglePrefix" and "Postfix",
	  with the first one being the default.
	- Fixed problem with Christoffel[cd, cdextended] not being declared as a
	  tensor, as reported by Leo on June 3 in the xAct group. Used this
	  oportunity to implement a better treatment of the "vanishing" info
	  messages for tensors. MakeDefInfo has now a fourth argument for this.
15 Jul	- TexUpIndex wraps IndexForm[index] with Tex to get proper formatting.
	  Thanks to Eduardo Serna for reporting this, and Thomas for fixing it.
	- Added better treatment of fractions and roots of numbers, as suggested
	  by Thomas.
	- Added Zero definitions for TensorDerivative[metric | epsilon | det, LCcovd],
	  as suggested by Leo.
	* Released 15 July 2011. Version 1.0.2.

1.0.3:
30 Sep	- Typo: RicciToEinsteinRule -> RicciToEinsteinRules. Found by Alfonso.
	- Added xHold to prevent evaluation in ToIndexExpr. Thanks to Stephen Green
	  and Leo Stein.
	- Changed MetricOfCovD[covd1] by delta in makeChangeRicciRule, as suggested
	  by Leo.
	- Added line FindIndices[expr_Condition]:=... Thanks to Teake.
	- Changed a Module[{c},...] to Module[{c=DummyIn@vbundle},...] in
	  ExtrinsicKToGradNormalRules, as suggested by Leo.
	* Released 10 October 2011. Version 1.0.3.
	- Changed signs in the definition of the Tetra-metric, to follow the
	  conventions in Penrose & Rindler.
	- Introduced option epsilonOrientationInBasis for DefMetric and
	  associated function epsilonOrientation. This function takes the default
	  value $epsilonSign, for backward compatibility.
	* Rereleased 25 October 2011. Version 1.0.3.

=== 2012 =====================================

1.0.4:
 1 Jan	- Added support for SeriesData in sections before Canonicalization.

=== 2013 =====================================

20 Jan	- Renamed Permute -> PermProduct, following change in xPerm.
	- Fixed evaluation leak in the MakeBoxes calls for tensors and covds.
	- UnsortedUnion renamed DeleteDuplicates, following change in xCore.
	- Removed spurious $RicciSign in TFRicciToRicciRules and
	  RicciToTFRicciRules. Spotted by Teake.
	- Implemented DropIndexBasis suggestion from Thomas, to allow the IndexRule
	  and MakeRule functions deal with dummy basis indices.
	- Added selection of AB indices in OToVcheck, as suggested by Cyril. Also
	  a call of GradNormalToExtrinsicK there, suggested by Thomas.
	- Added another AB selection in IndexSolve, also suggested by Cyril.
	- The function movedindices now understands inertheads. Contributed by Cyril.
	- ToInducedDerivative now accepts inertheads. Contributed by Cyril.
	- Important change in how the induced derivative act on non-projected
	  expressions, in particular the orthogonal vector and the ambient
	  metric. Suggested by Cyril. Watch out for this change.
26 Jan	- Extended Bracket to act on all types of scalars, as suggested by
	  Leo. Fixed a bug there, pointed out by him.
	- VarD extended to work on multi-argument scalar functions. Code
	  contributed by Leo, which includes now the Power case.
	- Warping factors in product metrics are now general scalars, as
	  suggested by Leo in the group.
	- Induced derivatives give zero on products of two or more orthogonal
	  vectors.
	- Extended SameDummies (actually ReplaceDummies2) to work on List
	  and Equal expressions, as suggested by Teake and Thomas in the
	  group.
	- Fixed a bug pointed out by Alfonso: SymmetryOf was not seing the
	  IndexList indices of the inert heads.
	- Extended and improved orthogonality checks, following Thomas.
	  In particular the code of GradNormalToExtrinsicKRules is more
	  general now.
	- Modified usage message of IsIndicesOf, as suggested by Cyril.
	- Added definition LieD[v[a]][v[b]] := 0 .
	- Added definition v[b] LieD[v[a]][w[-b]] := 0 if v[b]w[-b]==0.
	- OrthogonalToVectorQ is now public and protected. It handles
	  remembered information through upvalues of the tensor, as
	  suggested by Thomas.
	- Added definition ParamD[p][p] := 1, found after a discussion with
	  Guillaume in the group.
	- As suggested by Thomas, now we specify in error messages which
	  non-projected expression has been found.
	- Added automatic listability of equations, as discussed with
	  Alfonso.
	- Removed check of less than 2 manifolds in CheckZeroDerivativeStart,
	  because we might be working with one manifold and a tensor
	  DefTensor[v[a],{}].
	* Released 27 January. Version 1.0.5.

28 Jan	- Converted many _Symbol?CovDQ into _?CovD, to make CCovD work.
	  Not all.
30 Jan	- Added determinants to the ConformalRules, as pointed out by
	  Dario Bettoni in the group.
	- Added support for parametric derivatives in VarD, as I
	  recommended to Jan Oliver one year ago in the group.
	- Created google project xact-developer to keep track of bugs.
3 Feb	- SplitManifold and SplitVBundle were using SymbolRelations with
	  the wrong order of symbols, hence defining inverted relations
	  host/visitor.
24 Feb	- As suggested by Teake, added an explicit factor 3/4 for the
	  fontsize of the indices respect to that of the stem, instead
	  of hardwiring a fontsize 9 vs the standard 12 of the stem.
3 Mar	- Fixed sign of the symmetry of Gdelta for an odd half-number of
	  indices. Reported by Davide Cassani.
	- CovDOfMetric now admits two arguments [metric, torsion].
	  Introduced LC[metric] to return the Levi-Civita connection,
	  equivalent to CovDOfMetric[metric, Zero].
9 Mar	- HeadOfTensor has now two arguments and is public.
	- MultiplyHead is now public.
	- Following Leo's suggestion in the group, Bracket[a][v1, v2] is
	  now Bracket[v1, v2][a], so that it follows the general structure
	  tensor[inds]. Bracket[v1, v2] is now a xTensorQ object, which
	  allowed removing multiple special definitions for Bracket.
	- Extended PullBack to work on covariant derivatives.
	- Reverted again the host/visitor relations of SplitManifold and
	  SplitVBundle because they break the reasoning of constructing
	  the product out of the (already existing) factors. Hence the
	  product is a visitor of its (host) factors.
	- Reexecuted xTensor.nb in Mathematica 9.0.1. From now on the
	  development will be done in the last version of Mathematica,
	  instead of always using 5.2, as done until now.
	- Christoffels between connections of different base manifolds are
	  now converted into 0, with a Christoffel::base warning, instead
	  of throwing an error. This was suggested by Adam in the group.
	- Manifolds can be nonatomic now, to work with mappings.
16 Mar	- DefType functions now thread over a list in the first argument.
	- Construction of `Q and `pmQ functions centralized in VBundleIndexQ
	  and VBundleIndexPMQ respectively.
23 Mar	- TangentBundleOfManifold now evaluates to Tangent, which is what
	  we should always use. Nicer formatting for TangentM.
30 Mar	- SubmanifoldsOfManifold replaced with the (not identical, but
	  almost) SplittingsOfManifold. Same thing for the function
	  SubvbundlesOfVBundle and SplittingsOfVBundle.
	- The functions SubmanifoldQ and SubvbundleQ do not thread over
	  lists anymore. DisjointManifoldsQ and DisjointVBundlesQ still
	  take lists as arguments.
 7 Apr	- Fixed ProjectDerivativeRules, which was not careful with
	  divergencies, as pointed out by Filippo in the group.
	- DummyAs made public.
13 Apr	- Added new type Product, with DefProduct, etc, following Alfonso's
	  suggestions and code. ToCanonical extended to handle these objects.
	- TensorTimes renamed VerbatimProduct[Times], and now the argument
	  can be any product.
28 Apr	- Added Kernel/init.m.
26 May	- Option GivePerm of ToCanonical removed. Replaced by a simple Sow,
	  right now only used by Invar.
	- Eliminated Scalar1 and MarkBlocked. Functionality now implemented
	  in the simpler SimpleObjectQ. xSort1 also eliminated.
	- Eliminated $CommuteFreeIndices. Not needed anymore. Its role is
	  now played by the freesQ argument of ObjectOrder.
30 Jun	- Contractions of Gdelta. Imitate the GAMMA` package.
14 Jul	- Added xSortPrecedence, as suggested by Thomas.
	- Added missing definition of Symmetry1D on Symmetric/Antisymmetric
	  as reported by Leo in the group.
28 Jul	- Inert heads can be now nonatomic, as requested by Leo.
18 Aug	- Added missing torsion terms in ChristoffelToGradMetric, as reported
	  by Teake in the group.

24 Jan	- DefMetric now defines epsilon for a frozen metric, as suggested
	  by Alfonso.
	- Added function PrimeDagger suggested by Thomas.
	- Changed PrintAsString in section 2.6.3, Following Thomas suggestion.
	* Released 15 February. Version 1.1.0.

23 Feb	- Fix canonicalization for "Commutative" products.
	- Fix heuristics for placement of highly symmetric tensors in xSort.
	- Rewrite symListCombine to avoid hitting $IterationLimit.
	* Re-released 23 February. Version 1.1.0.

	* Released 28 September. Version 1.1.1.

=== 2015 =====================================

21 Apr	- Fix a problem with MakeSequenceBox of a singleton, as suggested
	  by Thomas.

22 Aug	- Add missing torsion terms in LieDToCovD, as suggested by Alfonso.

	* Released 23 August. Version 1.1.2.

=== 2016 =====================================

=== 2017 =====================================

=== 2018 =====================================

28 Feb  - Modified extraction of non-indexed scalars inside Scalar expressions.

	* Released 28 February. Version 1.1.3.

25 Mar	- Avoid having a visitor-host relation between two symbols for which
	  there is a master-servant chain between them.
	- Make sure that a symbol is not added twice to the list of visitors of
	  another symbol.

20 Oct	- Solve a problem pointed out by Michael Kopp and Cyril Pitrou, and
	  actually solved by Leo Stein. This problem had been introduced in
	  1.1.0 when adding VerbatimProduct.
	- Solve a typesetting problem with c-indices pointed out by Alfonso.

18 Nov	- Fix issue with finding indices of Object expressions, that was reported
	  in the forum in relation with (harmless, but spurious) validation messages
	  in xPand.
